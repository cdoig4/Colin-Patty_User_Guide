# Overview of myBCIT Email Instructions

Hello! Congrats on getting into BCIT üëè With a new school unfortunately comes with a new email system. This guide will walk you through some neat tips and tricks into how to use the myBCIT email system to make your life at school a lot easier.

The topics we cover are:

- Email forwarding
- Email signatures
- Replying to instructors

## Tools Used to Create Guide

Having struggle ourselves through using the email system, much of what we referenced was from our own personal experience. Classmate inputs were also taken to help provide the easiest streamlined guide.

### MkDocs

MkDocs provided a great way to provide an esthetic website build. It had several built in components that were easy to customize and provided a lot of variety in terms of themes and overall appearance.

### Markdown Language

For both team members, this was the first time we used Markdown language for a larger scale project. Having gone through Markdown walkthroughs it was beneficial to be able to apply our knowledge and gain experience with using the language.

### VSCode

Using VSCode we were able to work collaboratively on the same document by linking to a shared GitHub repository.
