# Overview of myBCIT Email Instructions

Hello! Congrats on getting into BCIT üëè With a new school unfortunately comes with a new email system. This guide will walk you through some neat tips and tricks into how to use the myBCIT email system to make your life at school a lot easier.

The topics we cover are:

- Email forwarding
- Email signatures
- Replying to instructors

## Tools Used to Create Guide

Having struggle ourselves through using the email system, much of what we referenced was from our own personal experience. Classmate inputs were also taken to help provide the easiest streamlined guide.

### MkDocs

MkDocs provided a great way to provide an esthetic website build. It had several built in components that were easy to customize and provided a lot of variety in terms of themes and overall appearance.

### Markdown Language

For both team members, this was the first time we used Markdown language for a larger scale project. Having gone through Markdown walkthroughs it was beneficial to be able to apply our knowledge and gain experience with using the language.

### VSCode

Using VSCode we were able to work collaboratively on the same document by linking to a shared GitHub repository.

### Writing Style and Organization

When writing this guide, we wanted to ensure that it would be welcoming and readable for the reader. Therefore we used language that was clear and concise to provide concrete instructions.

## Alert Blocks

To help ensure readability, we utilized the MkDocs' alert blocks to notify the reader about different types of information.  

Denotes actions that users must avoid taking to prevent issues.

## Layout

In addition to the alert blocks, we also utilized a built-in MkDocs navigation layout in order to show subsections nested within each page to allow readers to quickly move between them. This allows the reader to easily backtrack or move to a different page when needed.

### Conclusion

This documentation was made to help incoming BCIT students utilize their MyBCIT email account to the fullest while reducing the confusion that comes with some tasks. It was enjoyable for us to write as many of these tasks were things we had to figure out ourselves in our first term.  
Writing this documentation was also a fantastic opportunity for us to learn how to use MkDocs for documentation and write clear instructions for an intended audience.  
Thank you for taking the time to read this! We hope this documentation helps you figure out your MyBCIT email and that you pass it on to anyone else who may find it useful.
