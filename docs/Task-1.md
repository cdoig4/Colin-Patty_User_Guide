6. Give a name to your filter in the "Filter Name" box (ex. Forwarding to gmail).
7. Under "For incoming mail" select **All Messages**.  
  
    !!! note "Specific Filters"
        If you don't want to forward all messages, you can set specific filters by clicking **matching rules**. For example, "Title", "Contains", "Math" to only get math emails forwarded.

8. Under "...execute the following actions" select **Send Message Copy To** and enter your desired email address.

    !!! danger "Important"
        Do not select **Redirect Message To**. Keeping a copy of the email in your BCIT email allows you to reply using your school email address by going to the BCIT mailbox and replying there. If you redirect messages, you can only reply in your personal mailbox using your personal email address.

9. Click **Save** from the bottom right to save your changes.
