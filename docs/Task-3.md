# Replying to BCIT Instructor Emails

## Overview

This section will instruct you on how to reply to your BCIT instructor's email correctly! While it may sound simple, the email that instructors send from is often different from the one that we students receive. Using this guide should make this process much easier for you.

## Locating the Email to Reply to

1. Login to your myBCIT email.
 See detailed instructions in steps 1 and 2 in forwarding email for more instructions if necessary.

2. Locate the email from the instructor you wish to reply to.

3. Check the email address in the **From** box.
 If it looks similar to this [*insert image here*] you **should** be good to reply. If it doesn't look like this or the reply bounces back, proceed to the next section. **Make sure to leave this tab open on the email that you wish to reply to.**

## Locating the Correct Email Address

1. Navigate and login to your LearningHub in a separate tab.
 You should be logged in already after having logged into myBCIT. If not, enter your login credentials again.

2. Navigate to the instructor's course page.
 Note that some instructor's may have both a Lecture AND Lab page, you will have to check both in the next step if that's the case.

3. Check the Content page to see if the instructor's email has been posted there.
 Don't forget to check both Lecture AND Lab pages if they exist

 If the instructor's email **IS** present, move to step 6
