# Replying to BCIT Instructor Emails

### Overview

This section will instruct you on how to reply to your BCIT instructor's email correctly! While it may sound simple, the email address that instructors send from is often different from the one that we students receive. Using this guide should make this process much easier for you.

### Locating the Email to Reply to

1. Login to your [myBCIT](https://my.bcit.ca) email.

    !!! Note "More info"
        * Detailed instructions in steps 1 and 2 in [Forwarding Mail](Task-1.md) for more instructions if necessary

2. Locate the email from the instructor you wish to reply to.

3. Check the email address in the **From** box.  
 *Make sure to leave this tab open on the email that you wish to reply to.*

    !!! Note "Correct Email"
        + If it looks similar to this: ![image](./Colin's_Screenshots/Check_FROM_Email_Good.png) you *should* be good to reply. If it doesn't look like this or the reply bounces back, proceed to the next section.

### Locating the Correct Email Address

1. Navigate and login to your [LearningHub](https://learn.bcit.ca) in a separate tab.

    !!! Note "Lecture AND Lab"
        * Some instructor's may have both a Lecture AND Lab page, you will have to check both in the next step if that's the case.
